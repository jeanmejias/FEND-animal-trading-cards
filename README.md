# FEND Project 1: Animal Trading Cards

The description for this project reads as follows:

> Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a web-based trading card depicting your favorite animal.

The idea is to create a trading card (think football, Pok√©mon, Magic and so on) with one of your favorite animals on it. I chose the hawk because it is rather small, cute, romantic - but also swift and accurately deadly when need be!

I decided to rely heavily on CSS gradients and flexbox to make a ~~some-what responsive~~ (the assignment specified a fixed width of 300px for the image, responsiveness can be re-enabled by checking the CSS and removing the relevant comments) trading card that is also pleasing to the eye. There is not a lot of room on a trading card, so the amount of text is limited. On very small screens, the "interesting fact" (first paragraph, in italics) is dropped to ensure that all other content is readable. Of course the *type* of animal couldn't be left out. It is highlighted in a purple-ish color.
